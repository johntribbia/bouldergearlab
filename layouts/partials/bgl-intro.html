                    Every review at Boulder Gear Lab combines analytical thinking with extensive 
                    real-world testing. As a data scientist who's also a lifelong runner and cyclist, 
                    I bring a critical eye to gear evaluation - not through lab measurements, but through 
                    thousands of miles on Colorado's trails, roads, and mountains.

                    Good gear reviews require extensive field testing, comparative thinking, and honest 
                    assessment of both strengths and weaknesses. My background as a data scientist shapes 
                     how I think about products - asking the right questions, considering edge cases, and 
                    thinking critically about performance claims.
                <br><br>
                    Every review is independent, with no brand sponsorships influencing recommendations. 
                    The goal is to share real-world experience that helps you make informed decisions.
