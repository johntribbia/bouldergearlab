                        Every review combines analytical thinking with extensive real-world testing in the outdoor lab.
                        As a data scientist and lifelong runner, cyclist, and outdoor enthusiast, I evaluate gear
                        through thousands of miles on Colorado's trails, roads, and mountains - not through laboratory
                        measurements.

                        My background shapes how I approach products: asking the right questions, considering edge
                        cases, and thinking critically about performance claims. Every review is independent, with zero
                        brand sponsorships. The goal is honest objective assessment that helps readers make informed decisions.
