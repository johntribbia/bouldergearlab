In the hot, humid days of summer, there's nothing quite like a
refreshing drink to quench your thirst. But what if there was a drink
that could do more than just quench your thirst? What if there was a
drink that claims it could hydrate you, energize you, and even boost
your immune system?

That's where Liquid IV Hydration Multiplier comes in. Or does it?
