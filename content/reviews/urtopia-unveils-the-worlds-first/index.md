voice interaction powered by integrated ChatGPT is no exception.

## **World's First ChatGPT integrated eBike is Urtopia**

it firmly establishes Urtopia as the leader of the smart eBike market.
With the power of ChatGPT and Urtopia's voice recognition feature, the
Urtopia smart eBike becomes an exceptional companion for riders,

## **Cooperation with Apple's mastermind designer -- Hartmut Esslinger.**

Urtopia's smart features and commitment to ESG have caught the eye of
renowned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger. As the founder of Frog
Design and the mastermind behind Apple's iconic Snow White design
concept, Esslinger is a big fan of Urtopia's innovative products.
Together, they co-designed the highly anticipated Urtopia Fusion, which
was unveiled at EUROBIKE 2023. The Urtopia Fusion is a work of art,
weighing in at under 20kg and made entirely of carbon fiber. It features
stylish industrial design, all-road adaptability, and Urtopia's smart
system. Esslinger calls it "the iPhone of eBikes."
