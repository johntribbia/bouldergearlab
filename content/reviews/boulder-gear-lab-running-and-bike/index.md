## John Tribbia

John was born and raised in Boulder, CO and has been a regular technical
reviewer for running-oriented product testing website
[RoadTrailRun](http://www.roadtrailrun.com) with a large readership
domestically and internationally. He has other writing about NAAWK
[Sunscreen](https://naawkblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/03/dont-stow-away-the-sunscreen/)
and Yuba Cargo E-Bike ([Part
I](https://yubabikes.com/how-to-adopt-the-cargo-bike-lifestyle-step-1/),
[Part
II](https://yubabikes.com/how-to-adopt-the-cargo-bike-lifestyle-step-2/),
[Part
III](https://yubabikes.com/how-to-adopt-the-cargo-bike-lifestyle-step-3/),
[Part
IV](https://yubabikes.com/how-to-adopt-the-cargo-bike-lifestyle-step-4/)). 

John dabbled in bike racing both mountain and road as a junior Cat 5 and
eventually upgraded to Expert on the mountain bike. After his brief
stint of cycling racing and once in college, he crossed over to running
and found success as a sponsored mountain/trail runner by placing atop
the podium in domestic and international races. But he always kept his
bikes nearby for cross training while injured, supplemental training,
and commuting. Given that cross-over experience as well as 6+ years of
working at [University Bikes](https://www.ubikes.com/) in Boulder, CO
and over 20 years of competitive running, John loves the opportunity to
test the latest and greatest in both sports.
