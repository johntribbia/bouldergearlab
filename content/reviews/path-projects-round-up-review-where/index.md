**Fit**

Being a 5'6" runner who usually wears a small size, the Pyrenees T19
Hoodie's fit was unexpectedly roomy for me. While this may not be an
issue for everyone, it's important to mention that the small size was
quite loose on my frame. However, the bagginess didn't diminish the
overall comfort of the hoodie. Surprisingly, I found the extra space
rather enjoyable, particularly on cooler days when layering was
necessary.

### Overall Impression

The Pyrenees T19 Hoodie is a versatile and meticulously crafted apparel
designed for outdoor enthusiasts and runners. This lightweight and
breathable hoodie offers exceptional performance and comfort, making it
a perfect choice for various activities. Its thoughtful features include
sun protection, ensuring you stay shielded during your outdoor
adventures. Whether you're embarking on an extended trail run or seeking
a stylish and comfortable hoodie for daily wear, the Pyrenees T19 is a
worthwhile investment. Experience the harmonious blend of functionality
and style with this remarkable hoodie.

## Graves PX 7" Short: A Lightweight and Durable Workhorse


![image_2.png](image_2.png)


The [Graves PX 7"
Short](https://pathprojects.com/collections/shorts/products/graves-px-short)
($58) is a lightweight and durable running short designed for the most
grueling workouts. Constructed with Primeflex™ fabric from Toray, this
short offers exceptional breathability, abrasion resistance, and a soft
feel against the skin.

### Key Features

- **Primeflex™ Fabric:** This high-performance fabric provides excellent
  stretch, recovery, and breathability, without the added weight of
  traditional elastic materials.

- **Secure Pocketing System:** The Graves PX features multiple zip
  pockets for secure storage of essentials.

- **Separate Shorts and Base Liner System:** For optimal performance and
  comfort, Path Projects recommends pairing the Graves PX with one of
  their base liners.


![image_20.png](image_20.png)


### Performance

Having worn the Graves PX shorts for several weeks, I remain
consistently impressed by their performance. The lightweight Primeflex™
fabric feels incredibly comfortable, allowing effortless movement during
my runs. The shorts never restrict my movements or cause chafing, even
during longer runs.

The secure pocketing system is a lifesaver, allowing me to carry
essentials like my car key, ID cards, and a portable keychain alarm. The
pockets are spacious enough to accommodate my iPhone 12 mini with a slim
case without feeling bulky, although I rarely carry it on runs.

The separate shorts and base liner system are game-changers. The base
liner remains firmly in place, effectively wicking away moisture, while
the shorts ride comfortably on top, minimizing the risk of chafing.

**Fit**

Standing between sizes Small and Medium, I chose Medium this time. While
a Small might fit snugly but not overly tight, the Medium provides a
greater range of motion without any sense of restriction.

### Overall Impression

The Graves PX 7" Short is a fantastic piece of running apparel that I
highly recommend. Its lightweight fabric, secure pocketing system, and
compatibility with Path Projects base liners make it a versatile and
comfortable choice for runners of all levels.

performance of Path Projects running shorts. This liner offers superior
wicking, quick drying, and a comfortable fit.

### Key Features

  mechanical wicking, pulling moisture away from the skin and dispersing
  it for faster drying times.

- **Acrofuse™ Seam Technology:** Stitch-free seams provide unmatched
  mobility and prevent chafing.

- **Lightweight and Breathable:** The Linx PD is designed to be
  lightweight and breathable, keeping you cool and comfortable during
  your workouts.

### Performance

I've been using the Linx PD undershort liner with my Graves PX shorts,

moisture. The Toray Fieldsensor™ Byokan fabric does an excellent job of
wicking away sweat, keeping me dry and comfortable even during intense
