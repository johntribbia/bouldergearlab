### **Overall: Value for the Money**

The TENWAYS CGO600 Pro is a good value for the money. It's a
lightweight, affordable, and stylish eBike that's perfect for city
commuting or leisurely rides. The CGO600 Pro also has a powerful motor,
long battery life, and comfortable ride. At $1,999, the CGO600 Pro is a
reasonable price for lightweight eBikes. The greatest appeal of the bike
is its simple design and the incredibly low maintenance it requires as
well as the integrated lighting. This is a bike that can withstand the
weather with long lasting and easy to maintain parts such as the Gates
carbon belt drive, disk brakes, fenders, and automatic lights.

The CGO600 Pro is a bit unidimensional with a rigid front fork, but it
makes up for the bumpy riding in how lightweight it is overall - it is
an excellent option for roads and bike paths. With only a single speed
gearing, the bike is powerful enough to keep pace with stop and go
traffic as well as ascend steeper inclines on full power. As a frequent
commuter, I love the fenders for wet riding conditions. With the 360kW
battery, the range on the bike is excellent compared to other similarly
classed eBikes.

Ride - 7/10 (Smooth, quiet, easy, but a little rough)  
Fit - 8/10 (I don’t doubt my rating would have been better using a Small
frame size)  
Specs - 8/10 (at the price point, it is a great bike that can take you
from A to B)  
Fun Factor (out of 5) - 🙌 🙌 🙌   

Overall Average: 7.7 / 10
