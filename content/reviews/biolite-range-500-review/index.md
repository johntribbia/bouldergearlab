### BioLite Range 500 Headlamp ($69.95)


### 

As an avid early morning trail runner, a reliable headlamp is crucial, and I've experienced how innovative design can significantly improve essential gear. The  stands out in a crowded market by addressing common issues such as slow charging and inconsistent power. Its remarkably compact size and ultralight design are the highlights among other high quality features.

### Design

The Range 500 has a minimalist and what BioLite coins as a bounce-free 3D SlimFit Construction. The head unit is a sleek 9mm thick and is integrated directly into the moisture-wicking headband, making it feel more like a piece of apparel than a piece of hardware. The entire unit weighs only 2.6 oz (75 g), which I appreciate when I am an hour into a run.

Operating the headlamp is straightforward with its two-button interface, allowing for quick mode changes. It also features a useful lock mode to prevent accidental activation in your vest or bag. The IP67 waterproof rating means this headlamp is built to endure submersion, so rain or a fall into a puddle isn’t an issue.

### Comfort and Ergonomics

The slim profile and integrated battery pack create a stable fit that stays put during high-intensity activities. I’ve worn it for my typical 60-90 minute morning runs and have even taken it on longer 2+ hour trail adventures without any discomfort or need for readjustment. It actually feels more like a running headband than headlamp.

My main area for improvement would be to include a removable top strap. Although the current design offers reasonable stability for running and is marketed as “no-bounce”, a top strap would greatly enhance security, especially during downhill running sections where extended periods of looking down and faster paces can lead to excessive bouncing.

### Light Output

With a peak output of 500 lumens and a beam distance of 100 meters, the Range 500 provides ample light for navigating technical terrain. The dimmable modes are a key feature, allowing for precise control over brightness and battery consumption. The headlamp has a versatile range of modes, including a white spot, white flood, and white strobe, as well as red flood and red strobe options for preserving night vision.

The ability to switch between a focused beam for spotting trail markers and a wide flood for peripheral vision is invaluable.

### Battery Life and Charging

The battery life and charging speed are the Range 500’s most compelling features. The 1,634 mAh battery gives up to 6 hours of burn time on high and an impressive 200 hours on low.
But the real game-changer is the rapid-charging technology. An 8-minute charge provides a full hour of light at full brightness, which is a feature that has saved me when I've forgotten to charge the headlamp overnight. A full recharge takes only 80 minutes via a USB-C connection.

### Summary

The BioLite Range 500 stands out as a high-quality headlamp, living up to its promise of being a lightweight and comfortable lighting solution.
Its no-bounce design and rapid-charging feature make it an ideal choice for trail runners, hikers, and campers who prioritize reliability and convenience.
While not the most powerful option available, its balanced features establish it as a dependable and essential piece of gear, securing its spot in my morning running gear.

### Comparisons


### Moonlight Mountain Gear Bright as Day 800

While the Bright as Day 800 offers a more powerful 800-lumen output, it comes at a significant cost in weight (248g vs. 75g) and price ($199 vs. $69.95). The Moonlight is built like a tank with its aluminum construction and is designed for the most extreme conditions. However, for most users, the BioLite Range 500’s lighter weight, bounce-free comfort, and convenient rapid-charging make it the more practical choice for daily use.
