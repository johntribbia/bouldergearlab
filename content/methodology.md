# Testing Approach: Real-World Rigor

At Boulder Gear Lab, I don’t use treadmills or sensors. My "lab" is the high-alpine terrain of the Front Range. I replace sterile measurements with a systematic, analytical approach to how gear performs when it actually matters.

## The Testing Framework

Every review is built on a foundation of high-mileage exposure and comparative analysis. I don't publish "first impressions" only; I publish conclusions.

### 1. The Mileage Threshold
I believe gear doesn't reveal its true character in a weekend. Ideally, every product meets a strict minimum usage requirement before a review is written:
* **Running Shoes:** 50–150 miles across varied terrain.
* **Bikes & Components:** 100+ miles in diverse weather and trail conditions.
* **Apparel & Tech:** Extended seasonal use to test breathability, durability, and battery life.

### 2. The "Boulder" Variable
Living in Boulder, Colorado, provides a unique environmental stress test. My testing grounds include:
* **Vertical Extremes:** Testing breathability and gear shifts from 5,000 to 10,000+ feet.
* **Technical Terrain:** Pavement, gravel, jagged singletrack, and alpine scree.
* **Climate Swings:** 60°F temperature shifts, intense UV, high-altitude snow, and gale-force winds.

### 3. Analytical Synthesis
As a Data Scientist, I look past the marketing "hype" to identify the mechanical reality of a product. I evaluate gear based on:
* **Systemic Failure Modes:** Identifying where materials are likely to fail first.
* **Market Context:** Positioning the product against its direct competitors in price and performance.
* **Edge Case Performance:** How does it behave when conditions get ugly?

## Independence & Objectivity

Trust is the only currency in gear reviews. To remain 100% objective, I adhere to a strict code of conduct:

| I Do | I Do Not |
| :--- | :--- |
| Purchase gear at retail price. | Accept payment for positive coverage. |
| Disclose when a PR sample is being tested. | Allow brands to "preview" or edit my reviews. |
| Keep, return, or donate samples after testing. | Maintain any active athlete sponsorships. |
| Provide honest, unfiltered critiques. | Use manufacturer-provided talking points. |

## My Philosophy on Ratings

I evaluate products on a 1–10 scale across five core dimensions:
1.  **Fit & Comfort:** Is the geometry/ergonomics correct?
2.  **Performance:** Does it deliver on its primary intended use?
3.  **Durability:** How did it look at mile 1 vs. mile 100?
4.  **Value:** Does the performance justify the MSRP?
5.  **The "Fun" Factor:** Does this gear make you want to get outside?

## The Boulder Gear Lab Difference

Most reviews are based on a spec sheet. Mine are based on **100,000+ miles** of movement and a **PhD-level** commitment to asking the right questions. 

I’m not looking for the "best" gear — I’m looking for the *right* gear for specific people and specific conditions. No fluff. No hype. Just the data from the trail.
