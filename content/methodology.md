# Testing Approach

## Real-World Testing, Critical Thinking

Boulder Gear Lab reviews are built on extensive field experience and analytical thinking. I don't run lab tests or collect statistical measurements—instead, I bring a critical, systematic approach to evaluating how gear performs in the real world.

---

## My Testing Framework

### 1. Extensive Field Testing

Every product gets substantial use before I write about it:

**Running Shoes:** Minimum 100-200 miles across varied terrain  
**Bikes:** 200+ miles in different conditions  
**Apparel:** Multiple uses across different weather and activities  
**Technical Equipment:** Extended use until I understand its strengths and limitations

### 2. Colorado's Testing Grounds

Living in Boulder gives me access to incredibly diverse conditions:

- **Elevation:** 5,000 to 14,000+ feet
- **Terrain:** Technical singletrack, gravel, pavement, alpine
- **Weather:** Temperature swings of 60°F in a day, snow, sun, wind
- **Real-world scenarios:** Commuting, training, adventures

If gear works here, it'll work anywhere.

### 3. Comparative Thinking

I don't test products in isolation. Every review considers:

- How does this compare to similar products I've used?
- Where does it fit in the market at this price point?
- Who would this work well for? Who wouldn't it suit?
- What are the tradeoffs compared to alternatives?

### 4. Critical Analysis

My data science background shapes how I think about products:

- **Asking the right questions:** What problem is this solving? For whom?
- **Considering edge cases:** How does it perform in adverse conditions?
- **Evaluating claims:** Does it deliver on manufacturer promises?
- **Thinking systematically:** What are the failure modes? Durability concerns?

### 5. Long-Term Observation

Products stay in my rotation long after reviews are published. I track:

- Wear patterns over time
- Performance degradation
- What breaks first and why
- When it's time to replace

I update reviews when long-term use reveals important information.

---

## What I Track

While I'm not conducting lab measurements, I do pay attention to:

- **Usage:** Total miles, elevation gain, number of uses
- **Conditions:** Weather, terrain type, how gear performs in different scenarios
- **Durability:** How materials hold up, where wear occurs first
- **Fit & Comfort:** How things feel over long distances, throughout different activities
- **Practical details:** Weight (if relevant), features that matter in the field

---

## Independence & Objectivity

### How I Maintain Independence:

**I DO:**
- Purchase most gear at retail price
- Accept PR samples for evaluation (always disclosed)
- Provide honest assessments regardless of how I acquired products
- Return or donate PR samples after testing
- Maintain editorial control over all content

**I DON'T:**
- Have current sponsorships with brands I review
- Accept payment for positive coverage
- Allow brands to review content before publication
- Modify reviews based on brand feedback

## My Background

All testing is done by me, John Tribbia:

- **500,000+ miles** of running and cycling experience
- **Data scientist** with analytical training and critical thinking skills
- **Former sponsored athlete** (La Sportiva, Brooks, Pearl Izumi)—no current brand relationships
- **Colorado resident** since 2008 with deep knowledge of local conditions
- **20+ years** competing and testing gear across running and cycling
- **6+ years** working at University Bikes in Boulder

## Review Structure

### Rating System (1-10 or 1-5 scale):

I evaluate products across multiple dimensions relevant to each category:

- Overall impression
- Fit and comfort
- Performance in intended use
- Durability observations
- Value for the price
- Fun factor (because it matters!)

Ratings reflect my honest assessment after extensive field testing, not measurements or lab data.

### What You'll Find in Reviews:

- **First impressions:** Initial observations out of the box
- **Fit details:** How sizing works, who it's suited for
- **Real-world performance:** How it handles in various conditions
- **Comparisons:** How it stacks up against similar products
- **Pros & cons:** Honest assessment of strengths and weaknesses
- **Bottom line:** Who should buy this, who should look elsewhere

## The Difference

My reviews aren't based on:
- ❌ Lab measurements or quantitative testing
- ❌ Short-term impressions after a few uses
- ❌ Manufacturer talking points

They ARE based on:
- ✅ Hundreds of miles of real-world experience
- ✅ Critical, analytical thinking about performance
- ✅ Comparisons to similar products I've tested
- ✅ Honest assessment of strengths AND weaknesses
- ✅ Complete editorial independence

## Two Sides of the Lab

**Gear Reviews:** Thoughtful, experience-based evaluations of outdoor equipment

**Data Projects:** This is where the quantitative analysis lives—separate from gear reviews, this section will feature data science work, visualizations, and analytical projects
