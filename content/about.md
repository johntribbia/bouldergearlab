## Testing Gear Where It Matters Most

**Boulder Gear Lab** is built on hundreds of thousands of miles run and biked, and millions of vertical feet gained across the U.S. and around the world. Boulder Gear Lab is an authority on running shoes, bikes, cycling gear, and outdoor equipment - delivering honest, data-driven reviews for athletes and adventurers who demand real answers, not marketing hype.

**John Tribbia** and has spent his professional career and passion of the outdoors at the intersection of data science and the outdoor industry. By day, he's a Data Scientist at Google currently leading AI model evaluation. But his expertise in gear doesn't come from analysis alone — it comes from decades in the trenches of the outdoor industry and on the trails themselves.

### From the Industry to the Mountains

John's path into gear testing was forged on the retail floor at **[University Bicycles](https://www.ubikes.com)** in Boulder (6+ years), where he learned what actually matters when recommending equipment to real customers. He then spent years on the analytics side at **[Backcountry.com](https://www.backcountry.com)**, leading marketing analytics and developing the data infrastructure that helped one of the industry's biggest retailers optimize everything from pricing strategies to customer lifetime value.

But data and retail experience only tell half the story. As a **former sponsored mountain/trail runner** with La Sportiva, Brooks/Fleet Feet, Pearl Izumi, and Salomon, John has tested gear at the highest levels of competition - winning America's Uphill, Imogene Pass Run, and the US Skyrunner Vertical Kilometer Series, and setting multiple FKTs on iconic peaks in Boulder and Salt Lake City. He has raced domestically and internationally, understanding firsthand what separates marketing claims from real-world performance when you're pushing gear to its limits.

As an **Eagle Scout and NOLS graduate**, John has led backcountry trips and spent countless nights testing equipment in conditions that reveal its true character. He dabbled in mountain biking as a junior racer, logged thousands of miles on his Yuba cargo eBike and other eBikes he has tested, and maintained 20+ years of competitive running - still grinding up Boulder's steepest trails before dawn most mornings at paces ranging from 5 to 12 minutes per mile. His favorite terrain? 30-40% climbs that separate the curious from the committed.

### The Boulder Gear Lab Philosophy

This unique combination of outdoor industry experience, elite athletic background, and advanced data science mindset is what makes Boulder Gear Lab different. John knows what brands look for, what athletes need, and how to measure it objectively.

Every review can combine **quantitative analysis** (weight, durability metrics, performance benchmarks) with **real-world punishment** across Colorado's demanding conditions. Boulder Gear Lab tests gear over hundreds or thousands of miles because that's when the truth emerges: what holds up, what falls apart, and what's actually worth your money. Whether evaluating AI models for billions of Google users or trail running shoes on 30-40% grades, Boulder Gear Lab applies the same framework: rigorous testing, data-driven analysis, and evidence-based conclusions.

John is a regular contributor to **[Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com/search?q=john+tribbia)** and began reviewing shoes over 20 years ago; His reviews have been featured in Trail Runner Magazine, Triathlete Magazine, 5280,  Running Times, and other publications. John holds a PhD from CU-Boulder with expertise in statistical modeling, causal inference, and forecasting, skills he's applied in leadership roles at Oracle, Infor, InsideSales.com, and Backcountry before Google.

This is rigorous testing with evidence-based conclusions. No fluff, no marketing spin - just honest assessments from someone who's worked in the industry, competed at the highest levels, and broken in (and broken) more gear than most people will ever own.
