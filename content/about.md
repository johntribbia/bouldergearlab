        <p>
            <strong>Data Scientist. Trail Runner. Cyclist. Outdoor Enthusiast.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a former sponsored athlete turned independent gear reviewer based in Boulder, Colorado — a place where the terrain has a way of testing the limits of everything you bring into the foothills.
        </p>
        <p>
            With over 100,000 miles logged across trails and roads, I’ve spent decades exploring the outdoors. After years of representing brands like La Sportiva, Pearl Izumi, and Salomon, I now focus on providing completely independent reviews that combine analytical rigor with extensive field experience.

# Boulder Gear Lab
## The Philosophy

High-quality gear reviews require three things: exhaustive testing, critical thinking, and radical honesty. My background in data science shapes my approach — not through lab-coat measurements, but through systematic inquiry. I look for the "why" behind a product's performance and consider the real-world edge cases where gear usually fails.

I test products the way you actually use them: grinding up Colorado peaks, commuting through Front Range winters, and pushing limits on all-day efforts. No hype, no fluff — just real miles and honest feedback.

## Two Worlds, One Lab

### The Data Science Side
By day, I am a Data Scientist at Google, leading teams in analytics, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I hold a PhD in Sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in quantitative methods and research design. 

The "Lab" in Boulder Gear Lab refers to this mindset of rigorous problem-solving and critical thinking, rather than a sterile room full of sensors.

### The Gear Testing Side
I’ve spent twenty years testing gear through the lens of a competitive athlete. While I value my past partnerships with brands like La Sportiva, Pearl Izumi, and Salomon, those sponsorships are behind me. This allows me to maintain complete editorial independence.

I am also a regular contributor to [Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com), one of the most respected review platforms in the industry. [See my RTR reviews →](/roadtrailrun/)
