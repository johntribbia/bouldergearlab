## John Tribbia

Data Scientist. Trail runner. Cyclist. Former sponsored athlete turned independent gear reviewer. Based in Boulder, Colorado, where the terrain tests everything you bring.

I've logged *hundreds of thousands of miles* across running and cycling, held sponsorships with La Sportiva, Brooks, Pearl Izumi, Backcountry, and Salomon, and work as a data scientist at Google. Now I review gear completely independently, combining analytical thinking with extensive field experience.

## The Philosophy

Good gear reviews require extensive testing, critical thinking, and honest assessment. My data science background shapes how I approach reviews—not through statistical measurements, but through asking the right questions, thinking systematically about performance, and considering real-world edge cases.

I test products the way you'd actually use them: on Colorado trails, commuting through winter, pushing limits on long efforts. No lab tests. No hype. Just real experience and honest feedback.

## Two Worlds, One Lab

### The Data Science Side

By day, I'm a Data Scientist at Google, leading teams in analytics, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I hold a PhD in Sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in quantitative methods and research design.

This analytical training influences how I think about everything, including gear. But the "Lab" in Boulder Gear Lab refers to my approach to problem-solving and critical thinking, not to laboratory equipment or statistical testing of products.

### The Gear Testing Side

I've been testing gear through countless miles as a competitive runner and cyclist. Former sponsorships with La Sportiva, Brooks, Pearl Izumi, Backcountry, and Salomon have ended, giving me complete independence in reviews.

I'm also a regular contributor to [Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com), one of the running community's most trusted review platforms. [See my RTR reviews →](/roadtrailrun/)

## What's Coming

The **Gear Reviews** section focuses on real-world product testing and honest recommendations—that's what you're seeing now.

The **Data Projects** section will showcase my analytical work: data visualizations, statistical analysis, and quantitative projects. This is where the "data-driven" part really lives—separate from the gear reviews.
