# About Boulder Gear Lab

## Testing Gear Where It Matters Most

**Boulder Gear Lab** is built on hundreds of thousands of miles run and biked, and millions of vertical feet gained across the U.S. and around the world. Boulder Gear Lab is an authority on running shoes, bikes, cycling gear, and outdoor equipment—delivering honest, data-driven reviews for athletes and adventurers who demand real answers, not marketing hype.

I'm **John Tribbia** and I've spent my professional career and passion of the outdoors at the intersection of data science and the outdoor industry. By day, I'm a Data Scientist at Google currently leading AI model evaluation. But my expertise in gear doesn't come from analysis alone — it comes from decades in the trenches of the outdoor industry and on the trails themselves.

### From the Industry to the Mountains

My path into gear testing was forged on the retail floor at **University Bicycles** in Boulder (6+ years), where I learned what actually matters when recommending equipment to real customers. I then spent years on the analytics side at **Backcountry.com**, leading marketing analytics and developing the data infrastructure that helped one of the industry's biggest retailers optimize everything from pricing strategies to customer lifetime value.

But data and retail experience only tell half the story. As a **former sponsored mountain/trail runner** with La Sportiva, Brooks/Fleet Feet, Pearl Izumi, and Salomon, I've tested gear at the highest levels of competition - winning America's Uphill, Imogene Pass Run, and the US Skyrunner Vertical Kilometer Series, and setting multiple FKTs on iconic peaks in Boulder and Salt Lake City. I've raced domestically and internationally, understanding firsthand what separates marketing claims from real-world performance when you're pushing gear to its limits.

As an **Eagle Scout and NOLS graduate**, I've led backcountry trips and spent countless nights testing equipment in conditions that reveal its true character. I dabbled in mountain biking as a junior racer, logged thousands of miles on my Yuba cargo eBike and other eBikes I've tested, and maintained 20+ years of competitive running - still grinding up Boulder's steepest trails before dawn most mornings at paces ranging from 5 to 12 minutes per mile. My favorite terrain? 30-40% climbs that separate the curious from the committed.

### The Boulder Gear Lab Philosophy

This unique combination—outdoor industry experience, elite athletic background, and advanced data science expertise is what makes Boulder Gear Lab different. I know what brands look for, what athletes need, and how to measure it objectively.

Every review can combine **quantitative analysis** (weight, durability metrics, performance benchmarks) with **real-world punishment** across Colorado's demanding conditions. I test gear over hundreds or thousands of miles because that's when the truth emerges: what holds up, what falls apart, and what's actually worth your money. Whether I'm evaluating AI models for billions of Google users or trail running shoes on 30-40% grades, I apply the same framework: rigorous testing, data-driven analysis, and evidence-based conclusions.

I'm a regular contributor to [Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com/search?q=john+tribbia) with reviews featured in Trail Runner Magazine, Triathlete Magazine, 5280, and Running Times. I hold a PhD in Sociology from CU Boulder with expertise in statistical modeling, causal inference, and forecasting—skills I've applied in leadership roles at Oracle, Infor, InsideSales.com, and Backcountry before Google.

This is rigorous testing with evidence-based conclusions. No fluff, no marketing spin—just honest assessments from someone who's worked in the industry, competed at the highest levels, and broken in (and broken) more gear than most people will ever own.
