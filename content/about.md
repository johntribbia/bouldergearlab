## Where Data Meets the Trail

I'm **John Tribbia**, a Data Scientist and outdoor enthusiast based in Boulder, Colorado. Boulder Gear Lab is where I apply the same rigorous, analytical approach to two things I'm passionate about: evaluating technology and testing outdoor gear.

### The Professional Lab

In my professional life, I am a data science leader with expertise in applying advanced analytics, ML, and scalable data infrastructure to drive business value. Proficient in statistical modeling, causal inference, and predictive forecasting to generate data-derived insights that inform strategic decision-making. Leverages a strong technical background and a comprehensive understanding of human behavioral systems to architect and deploy robust, customer-centric analytical solutions.

 My background spans:

- **Advanced Analytics & ML**: Forecasting, statistical modeling, A/B testing, causal inference, and LLM applications
- **Technical Leadership**: Managing cross-functional teams, setting quality standards, and driving data-driven decision-making
- **Education**: PhD in Sociology (University of Colorado Boulder) with a focus on social statistics and demography

### The Gear Lab

Colorado's demanding conditions provide the perfect testing ground for outdoor equipment. Whether it's trail running shoes, backpacking gear, or technical apparel, I bring a data-driven perspective to gear evaluation.

My reviews include:
- **Quantitative analysis**: Weight comparisons, durability, performance 
- **Real-world testing**: Extensive use in Colorado's varied terrain and weather
- **Honest assessment**: Both strengths and weaknesses, backed by evidence

I also contribute regular reviews to [Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com), where I provide detailed analysis of running shoes and gear.

### The Philosophy

The "Lab" isn't just a name—it's an approach. Whether I'm:
- Evaluating user, product and/or business performance in my professional life
- Testing trail running shoes on Boulder's mountain trails
- Building predictive models
- Analyzing gear durability over hundreds of miles

...I apply the same methodology: rigorous testing, data-driven analysis, and evidence-based conclusions.

### Beyond the Lab

When I'm not testing gear or building models, you'll find me:
- 🏔️ Trail running in Colorado's Front Range
- 🎓 Teaching and Mentoring
- 🦅 Eagle Scout and NOLS graduate

### Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers. You can find me on:
