# About Boulder Gear Lab

## Where Data Meets the Trail

I'm **John Tribbia**, a Data Scientist and outdoor enthusiast based in Boulder, Colorado. Boulder Gear Lab is where I apply the same rigorous, analytical approach to evaluating technology and testing outdoor gear.

### The Professional Lab

I specialize in transforming abstract problems into operational strategies and actionable insights. Currently, I'm leading the response quality measurement strategy for AI models across Google Workspace, building evaluation frameworks that guide engineering teams in creating reliable AI experiences for billions of users.

My background includes a PhD in Sociology from CU Boulder, plus leadership roles at Oracle, Infor, InsideSales.com, and Backcountry. I've spent my career developing analytics solutions spanning statistical modeling, forecasting, causal inference,A/B testing, and LLM applications—always focused on translating complex data into clear insights that drive better decisions.

### The Gear Lab

Born and raised in Boulder, Colorado has meant over 35 years as an avid outdoors-person, providing me with deep knowledge of how gear performs in demanding conditions. My testing credentials include:

* **Eagle Scout and NOLS graduate** with extensive backcountry experience
* **10+ years racing domestically and internationally** as a sponsored trail runner
* **Former longtime employee** at [University Bicycles](https://www.ubikes.com/) in Boulder and MTB racer as a junior
* **Over 100K miles** on my feet, bikes, and eBikes, testing gear in real-world conditions
* **Regular contributor** to [Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com/search?q=john+tribbia) contributor and product reviewer since 2006

My reviews have been featured in Trail Runner Magazine, Triathlete Magazine, 5280, Running Times, and other publications. I've also written in-depth pieces on topics ranging from [winter sun protection](https://www.bouldergearlab.com/reviews/2024/01/01/naawk-sunscreen/) and [snowshoe running](https://www.bouldergearlab.com/reviews/2024/01/01/snowshoe-running/) to comprehensive [cargo eBike analysis](https://www.bouldergearlab.com/reviews/2024/01/01/how-to-adopt-the-cargo-bike-lifestyle-101/).

Colorado's varied terrain and weather provide the perfect testing ground for outdoor equipment. Whether it's trail running shoes, outdoor gear, technical apparel, or bicycles, I bring both a data-driven perspective and decades of real-world experience to gear evaluation.

My reviews include:

* **Quantitative analysis**: Weight comparisons, durability metrics, performance benchmarks
* **Real-world testing**: Extensive use across Colorado's varied terrain and conditions
* **Honest assessment**: Evidence-backed evaluation of both strengths and weaknesses
* **Long-term perspective**: Testing over hundreds or even thousands of miles to identify true durability and value

### The Philosophy

The "Lab" isn't just a name—it's an approach. I tackle mountains of data the same way I tackle mountains on the run: with unrelenting determination. Whether I'm evaluating user engagement metrics in my professional life, testing trail running shoes on Boulder's mountain trails, building predictive models, or analyzing gear durability over extensive mileage, I apply the same rigorous framework: comprehensive testing, data-driven analysis, and evidence-based conclusions.

This combination of technical expertise, outdoor experience, and analytical rigor enables me to provide perspectives that are both deeply informed and practically useful.

### Beyond the Lab

When I'm not testing gear or building models, you'll find me:

* 🏔️ Trail running in Colorado's Front Range (occasionally startling unsuspecting hikers as I blaze past wearing thigh-exposing shorts)
* 🚴 Commuting and adventuring on my cargo eBike
* 🎓 Teaching, mentoring, and tutoring CU-Boulder students
* 🏆 Contributing to the Boulder community (2024 Google-Boulder Site Citizenship Award winner)

### Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers. You can find me on:
