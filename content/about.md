        <p>
            Data Scientist. Trail runner. Cyclist. Outoor enthusiast. Former sponsored athlete turned 
            independent gear reviewer. Based in Boulder, Colorado, where the terrain 
            tests everything you bring.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've logged over 100K+ miles across running and cycling and hiking, held sponsorships 
            with La Sportiva, Brooks, Pearl Izumi, Backcountry, and Salomon, and work as a data scientist at Google. 
            Now I review gear completely independently, combining analytical thinking with 
            extensive field experience.

## The Philosophy

Good gear reviews require extensive testing, critical thinking, and honest assessment. My data science background shapes how I approach reviews — not through statistical measurements, but through asking the right questions, thinking systematically about performance, and considering real-world edge cases.

I test products the way you'd actually use them: on Colorado trails, commuting through winter, pushing limits on long efforts. No lab tests. No hype. Just real experience and honest feedback.

## Two Worlds, One Lab

### The Data Science Side

By day, I'm a Data Scientist at Google, leading teams in analytics, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I hold a PhD in Sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in quantitative methods and research design.

This analytical training influences how I think about everything — including gear. But the "Lab" in Boulder Gear Lab refers to my approach to problem-solving and critical thinking, not to laboratory equipment or statistical testing of products.

### The Gear Testing Side

I've been testing gear through thousands of miles as a competitive runner and recreational cyclist. Former sponsorships with La Sportiva, Brooks/Fleet Feet, Pearl Izumi, Backcountry, and Salomon have ended, giving me complete independence in reviews.

I'm also a regular contributor to [Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com), one of the running community's most trusted review platforms. [See my RTR reviews →](/roadtrailrun/)
