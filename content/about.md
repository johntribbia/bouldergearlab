## Testing Gear Where It Matters Most

**Boulder Gear Lab** is built on hundreds of thousands of miles run and biked, and millions of vertical feet gained across the U.S. and around the world. We deliver honest gear reviews for athletes and adventurers who demand real answers, not marketing hype.

**John Tribbia** has spent his career at the intersection of data science and the outdoor industry. By day, he's a Data Scientist at Google leading AI model evaluation. But his gear expertise comes from decades in the outdoor industry and on the trails themselves—not from spreadsheets alone.

### From the Industry to the Mountains

John's path into gear testing was forged on the retail floor at **[University Bicycles](https://www.ubikes.com)** in Boulder (6+ years), where he learned what actually matters when recommending equipment to real customers. He then spent years on the analytics side at **[Backcountry.com](https://www.backcountry.com)**, leading marketing analytics and developing the data infrastructure that helped one of the industry's biggest retailers optimize everything from pricing strategies to customer lifetime value.

But data and retail experience only tell half the story. As a **former sponsored mountain/trail runner** with La Sportiva, Brooks/Fleet Feet, Pearl Izumi, and Salomon, John has tested gear at the highest levels of competition - winning America's Uphill, Imogene Pass Run, and the US Skyrunner Vertical Kilometer Series, and setting multiple FKTs on iconic peaks in Boulder and Salt Lake City. He has raced domestically and internationally, understanding firsthand what separates marketing claims from real-world performance when you're pushing gear to its limits.

As an **Eagle Scout and NOLS graduate**, John has led backcountry trips and spent countless nights testing equipment in conditions that reveal its true character. He dabbled in mountain biking as a junior racer, logged thousands of miles on his Yuba cargo eBike and other eBikes he has tested, and maintained 20+ years of competitive running - still grinding up Boulder's steepest trails before dawn most mornings at paces ranging from 5 to 12 minutes per mile. His favorite terrain? 30-40% climbs that separate the curious from the committed.

### The Boulder Gear Lab Philosophy

This combination of outdoor industry experience, elite athletic background, and analytical training makes Boulder Gear Lab different. John knows what brands look for, what athletes need, and how to evaluate it honestly.

Every review applies **analytical thinking** to real-world gear performance across hundreds of miles in Colorado's demanding conditions. That means examining design, testing durability, and identifying what actually holds up versus what falls apart—then reporting it honestly. Whether evaluating AI models at Google or trail running shoes on 30-40% grades, the same principle applies: observe carefully, think critically, report truthfully. No fluff. No marketing spin.

John is a regular contributor to **[Road Trail Run](https://www.roadtrailrun.com/search?q=john+tribbia)** and began reviewing shoes over 20 years ago; His reviews have been featured in Trail Runner Magazine, Triathlete Magazine, 5280,  Running Times, and other publications. John holds a PhD from CU-Boulder with expertise in statistical modeling, causal inference, and forecasting, skills he's applied in leadership roles at Oracle, Infor, InsideSales.com, and Backcountry before Google.

This is rigorous testing with honest analysis. No fluff. Just real assessments from someone who's worked in the industry, competed at the highest levels, and tested more gear than most people will ever own.
