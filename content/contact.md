## For Brands & PR Agencies

### Product Review Requests

I'm always interested in testing innovative gear that pushes boundaries. However, I'm selective about what I review to ensure quality and relevance for readers.

**Before reaching out:**
- Read our [Testing Methodology](/methodology/)
- Understand that we maintain editorial independence — no guaranteed positive coverage
- Be prepared for honest feedback, including product weaknesses

**What I look for:**
- Products that solve real problems for runners, cyclists, or outdoor enthusiasts
- Innovation in design, materials, or approach
- Value propositions at various price points
- Gear suited for Colorado's demanding conditions

**Send review requests to:** [john@bouldergearlab.com](mailto:john@bouldergearlab.com)

**Include:**
- Product name and category
- Key features and intended use case
- What makes it different from competitors
- MSRP and availability
- Link to product page

**Response time:** I review all requests but may not respond if the product isn't a fit. If you don't hear back within a week, it likely wasn't selected for testing.

## Based In

**Boulder, Colorado, USA**

Perfect for testing in elevation, variable weather, and diverse terrain. Not great for beach gear reviews.
