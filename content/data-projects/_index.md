## Data-Driven Insights

A collection of analytical projects exploring outdoor sports, equipment trends, climate data, and performance analytics. These projects showcase how data science applies to understanding the outdoor industry, athlete behavior, and environmental patterns.

Each project demonstrates practical applications of statistical analysis, causal inference, and forecasting—the same rigorous thinking that informs gear reviews at Boulder Gear Lab.
