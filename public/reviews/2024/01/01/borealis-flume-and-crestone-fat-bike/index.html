<p>Borealis Crestone</p>
<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, <a href="https://www.fatbike.com/">Borealis Fat
Bikes</a> is a company that specializes in
manufacturing high-quality fat bikes, which are bicycles with extra-wide
tires that are designed for riding on snow, sand, and other challenging
terrain. The company was founded in 2009 by Steve Kaczmarek, who was
inspired by the growing popularity of fat biking and saw an opportunity
to create a line of high-performance fat bikes.</p>
<p>Kaczmarek had a background in bicycle manufacturing and had previously
worked for a number of companies in the industry. He used his experience
and knowledge to develop a line of fat bikes that were lightweight,
durable, and capable of handling a variety of terrain.</p>
<p>Borealis Fat Bikes started wide distribution in 2013 and quickly gained
a reputation for their high-quality and innovative designs. The company
has since grown rapidly. Today, Borealis Fat Bikes continues to produce
a range of high-performance fat bikes that are popular with riders all
over the world. The company is known for its attention to detail and its
commitment to quality, and its bikes are known for their durability and
versatility.</p>
<p>They are truly top of the line in fat bikes. The
<a href="https://www.fatbike.com/crestone">Crestone</a> model is their carbon frame
bike and is as good as it gets, while the
<a href="https://www.fatbike.com/flume">Flume</a> is the aluminum version retaining
nearly the same geometry and is a capable beast of a bike as well. Jeff
V tested the Crestone while John tested the Flume. Both bikes were
spec’d with high quality components and ready to ride upon delivery.
Speaking of delivery, Borealis is a true family business with our bikes
being hand delivered by Steve’s son who traveled from Colorado Springs
to the Boulder area with a trunk full of fat bikes and delivered them
directly. </p>
<p>Above, our review sample Crestone on the left, plus my friend Simon’s
Crestone on the right, a muddy day!</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff:  Lightweight build, the highest quality carbon craftsmanship,
attention to detail, rugged durability, versatility (a great bike on
and off the snow), agile, responsive geometry</p>
<p>John: perfect for riding on snow, loose dirt, and other challenging
terrain; lightweight and nimble that is easy to maneuver and control;
surprisingly fast and agile; comfortable and upright riding position
that is good for long rides; customizable range of high-quality
components</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>John: Some riders may find the bike to be on the heavier side;
depending on how you choose to spec the bike, it could get pricey</p>
<p>Jeff: I really cannot come up with a con, this bike is awesome!  </p>

<h3 id="first-impressions"><strong>First</strong> <strong>Impressions</strong></h3>
<p>John: Overall, I was very impressed with the <a href="https://www.fatbike.com/flume">Borealis Flume Fat
Bike</a>. The bike is well-made and durable,
and it is super stable while riding on snow, loose dirt, and other
challenging terrain. It has a comfortable and secure feeling ride thanks
to its low center of gravity and slack head tube angle. The rigid carbon
fork provides sufficient shock absorption and control, making the bike
feel planted and confident on rough trails. The drivetrain is smooth and
reliable, with a 1x12 wide range of gears for climbing and descending.
The hydraulic disc brakes offer excellent stopping power in all
conditions, and the tires provide good traction, grip, and dampening of
harsh terrain. </p>
<p>In addition, I love that the lightweight, 6000-series aluminum frame
comes with 2-3 bottle cage mounts, rear rack mounts on the seat stays
and Lizard Skin protectors on both the down tube and drive-side
chainstay. The placement of those protectors are a clear sign of the
attention to detail Borealis puts into their designs – I find those
areas get beat up really quickly. Similarly, there is internal cable
routing for the dropper post, front derailleur, and the front + rear
through axles, which makes the frame look sleek and free of any errant
cables.</p>
<p>The Flume tackling a perfect condition day on the Front Range of
Colorado</p>
<p>Jeff:  Right off the bat I was in awe of the <a href="https://www.fatbike.com/crestone">Borealis
Crestone</a>.  One quick lift of the
bike, I was amazed at how light it feels, at just 26 lbs for a size
medium, fat tired bike, I could hardly believe it.  The green colored
carbon fiber Crestone frame has a deep and textured look to it,
sparkling in the sun and changing almost as if magic in different
lighting conditions and sun angles.  The construction, design, geometry
and angles of the frame and fork make it clear that the folks at
Crestone really know what they are doing and have not only supreme frame
building skills, but have a keen sense of blending high performance and
practicality.  The bike is a work of art.</p>

<h3 id="ride"><strong>Ride</strong></h3>
<p>John: On snow, the Flume performs incredibly well, with the wide tires
providing good flotation and traction. The rigid carbon fork helps to
smooth out the ride and improve control on slippery surfaces. I
personally prefer having a rigid fork as opposed to front suspension,
because I like feeling the snowy terrain underneath. Not to mention, the
fat tires do an outstanding job of dampening any moderate bumps and
offering some compliance to the ground. Despite the appearance with its
huge tires, the Flume is really agile and nimble, making it a good
choice for winter riding and dry trails. Here in the Front Range of
Colorado, the mix of terrain and conditions is a perfect setting to test
the versatility of any mountain bike, especially a fat bike. I was able
to take the Flume on dry dirt, rutty dried out mud, fresh packed snow,
and melted out frozen snow. To be frank, the bike handles all of those
conditions really well. It floats atop the unstable terrain like snow
and loose dirt and yet can dig into mud or wet snow.  I would be remiss
to mention that I really enjoyed how it rides on flat hardpack dirt or
road – It goes a lot faster than I would have guessed. I think one
reason is that Borealis designed the bike to have a standard cross
country mountain bike frame geometry. I love climbing and I found the
compact geometry generates a stiff push off on the incline. It felt
really familiar to ride and I didn’t require any acclimation. In fact, I
think the Flume would be an excellent entry level mountain bike for any
aspiring rider, since it offers the same comfortable fit and a lot more
traction and stability. The short stem and wide handlebars help with
handling and confident riding. </p>
<p>Jeff:  John sums up the ride quite well and I agree on all points.  The
frame geometry is steady, stable, efficient, yet quick and agile without
feeling twitchy.  The shorter stem and wide bars aid in excellent
maneuverability and steering confidence.  I too love to climb and the
Crestone performs amazingly well, in part because of its geometry and
also its stiff frame that allows all of the rider’s power to be
transmitted with no wasted energy.  Weighing only 26 lbs certainly helps
as well.  The fat 4.3” tires in 27.5 circumference certainly help smooth
the ride and I found the ride to be smooth on most snowy surfaces and
most other mildly technical surfaces.  I was able to test the Crestone
on just about everything from smooth packed snow, deep snow, slush, mud,
frozen foot print holed snow, dry dirt smooth singletrack, rocky
technical trails and some fast, somewhat rough (rough at speed)
downhilling.  While I think the rigid carbon fork is appropriate for
most situations, I found that when riding higher speed bumpy downhills,
I got bounced around a good bit, reminding me of riding fat tired 3
wheelers back in the 80’s.  Certainly not a knock on the Crestone, but
just the nature of riding a fat tire bike too fast.</p>
<h3 id="fit"><strong>Fit</strong></h3>
<p>John: The Borealis Flume has a comfortable and relaxed fit, with a roomy
cockpit and upright riding position. The bike is designed to be
versatile and accommodating, with a wide range of riders able to find a
comfortable position. I’m 5’6” and have a short torso. I would
characterize the fit as compact with precise handling abilities. Similar
to other hardtails like the Pivot LES 2 or the Specialized Epic HT, the
Flume has a comparable reach. Moreover, the geometry of the bike puts
your body over the pedals, ensuring optimal pedal position for power and
speed. The dropper seat post that was added to our bikes was the first
time I’ve used the technology. It was incredibly useful for on-the-fly
adjustments and was quite precise. </p>
<p>Jeff:  John sums up the specifics of the fit well and I have the same
overall impressions.  I am 5’9” tall, but have a 34” inseam and short
torso.  The size medium/17” fits me well and reach is just right with
the 50mm stem, putting me in a comfortably upright position without
feeling stretched.  With my long legs, I have the seatpost maxed out for
most riding, though often use the dropper post to lower my position an
inch or two if things get technical or if I am having to hop on/off in
difficult riding conditions.  This is my first introduction to a dropper
post and was only vaguely aware of them, until Matej Mahoric’s historic
victory at Milan San Remo last year where he used a dropper post to his
advantage for his aggressive attack down the Poggio.  While I will not
be pulling off any downhill road bike attacks anymore, having a dropper
post to me is a real advantage, always being able to optimize your seat
height to match the terrain.  I did occasionally find myself confusing
the dropper lever for a front derailleur lever, as I am not used to
riding a 1x.  One other advantage I found with the dropper is that if
you share your bike, it is easy to make a quick adjustment, as I let my
wife and daughters ride the Crestone on occasion.  </p>

<p>My daughter who is 5’3” loves riding the Crestone and actually fit well
on the size medium with some room to grow (the dropper post helps a
lot).  If I were to keep the bike, she would probably take it over, as
it was hard to wrestle it back from her.  She could write her own
review.</p>

<p>Both bikes we received to review were amazingly well spec&rsquo;d. The
Crestone came with a full SRAM Eagle GX 1 x 12 spd group set which
provides amazingly clean, crisp and accurate shifting. The Flume was set
up with SRAM Eagle NX 1 x 12, which was incredibly performant. </p>

<p>The 12spd cassettes have an incredible 10-50 range (with a 30T front). 
This combo is adequate for most of the riding that we’ve done and
surprisingly did not wish for a double or triple chainring up front.</p>

<p>Up front on the Crestone we have a SRAM Eagle DUB GX crankset made of
forged aluminum, which is light and stiff, coupled with a SRAM DUB
bottom bracket that gives no flex.  The Q factor is quite wide here, but
was not particularly noticeable.  The Borealis platform pedals are broad
with a secure grip.</p>
<p> <br>
Likewise, the Flume came with a SRAM DUB NX Crank that felt powerful and
stiff under the hardest pedal strokes. </p>
<p>Jeff: For most snow riding, I went with the platform pedals where I
wanted to wear a warmer shoe than my Sidi Dominator shoes, though when
it was warmer and dry, I went with clipless for better efficiency.</p>

<p>Holding the stem in place is a 35x50BLK Borealis branded stem, which is
stocky and strong.</p>
<p>The SRAM Eagle GX (Crestone) and NX (Flume) 12spd rear derailleurs
accommodate a wide range of gears and provide smooth and positive
shifting under any load. They are quick and efficient, especially for
the lazy shifter (ahem, John) who forgets to get in an appropriate
climbing gear when the terrain steepens.</p>
<p>The SRAM Eagle 12spd trigger shifter and Guide RS G2 brakes on the
Crestone make for a great combo, with the shifters being easy to operate
with a mitten, as well as positive lever activation and modulation.</p>
<p>The SRAM NX trigger shifters and Level T hydraulic brakes on the Flume
posed no problems and brought confidence in my shifting and braking in
warm and colder weather. </p>

<p>The tires are Terrene YKY 27.5 x 4.3 Yipee Ki Yay, which offer excellent
flotation and traction on loose surfaces, yet roll surprisingly well on
hard surfaces.<br>
The Flume came with Mulefoot 26x80 wheelset and Terrene Cake Eater
26x4.6 tubeless tires. The combo is light and sturdy. With both
wheelsets, we were both surprised at how quick the bike felt on flat
concrete. </p>

<p>John: The Borealis Flume Fat Bike is a stable, surprisingly nimble, fat
tire mountain bike that can tackle any type of terrain you throw at it.
Because it performs well in snow, loose dirt, and technical terrain with
reasonable vertical compliance and it performs well on harder surfaces
like dirt roads, I find it to be a nice versatile option for all types
of riders. In fact, it is an excellent bike for newer mountain bike
riders who desire greater stability and traction. Moreover, the range of
gears on the 1x12 drivetrain ensures no climb is too steep. </p>
<p>This bike is suited for endurance enthusiasts to weekend warriors to
serious brave-the-cold rider who will take to the snow on any occasion.
At $2,250 in the base model, it is reasonably priced for hardtails on
the market and it comes equipped with high quality components and a
lightweight frame! While I would still prefer a traditional hardtail for
summer months, I do like that the Flume is able to go anywhere at any
time.</p>
<p>Ride - 9.5/10 (surprisingly fast, stable, and compliant on the bumpy
stuff)<br>
Fit - 10/10 (I made zero adjustments after finding the right saddle
height)<br>
Specs - 9.5/10 (top quality for their entry level version)<br>
Fun Factor (out of 5) - 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌</p>
<p><strong>Overall Average: 9.7 / 10</strong></p>

<p>Jeff:  I cannot say enough good things about the Borealis Crestone.  The
frame quality and craftsmanship, attention to detail, well thought out
features and componentry make Borealis the obvious choice if you are in
the market for the best Fat Bike money can buy.  It is incredibly
lightweight with efficient geometry which makes it exceptionally easy to
ride.  The owners/staff are very easy to work with and attentive, they
really know their game and I will be sending potential buyers their way
for the indefinite future.</p>
